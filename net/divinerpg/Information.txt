This is the information file, update this for things you need done ect or just for information

TO DO
Add the rest of the overworld mobs
Start on the twilight mobs
The Config isnt working, find out why (it doesnt write to the file)

CHAT MESSAGES!!!! http://prntscr.com/2kkht3
The normal mobs will extend "EntityDivineRPGMob" and the boss's will extends "EntityDivineRPGBoss"

Inside both classes, there is a abstract method, its to name the mob, so the death chat for the mob will say what the mobs name is.

The Config has a option for it to show the chat messages or not.
