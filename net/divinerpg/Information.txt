This is the information file, put things that need to be done here.

TO DO
Add the rest of the Overworld mobs.
Start on the twilight mobs.

CHAT MESSAGES http://prntscr.com/2kkht3
The normal mobs will extend "EntityDivineRPGMob" and the boss's will extends "EntityDivineRPGBoss"

Inside both classes, there is a abstract method, its to name the mob, so the death chat for the mob will say what the mobs name is.

The Config has a option for it to show the chat messages or not.
